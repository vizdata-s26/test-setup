With this very simple plot.

Make the following changes to the code cell below:

1. Change the figure width and aspect ratio by adding code cell options to make the figure 5 inches wide and have an aspect ratio of 0.6.
2. Add a title to the plot that says "Miles per gallon vs. weight".

Then, render, commit, and push your changes.
